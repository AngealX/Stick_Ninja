# Stick Ninja Clone:

Here is a game clone of the app named "Stick Hero" which was created by the company KetchApp
In this game, I have utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create this game from scratch. In
my code I provide commments to give an understanding on what is going on in the code

# Basic Rundown:

The game has five different phases that the code imitates which are:

1. The game waits for the user input (this being pressing the down on mouse)

2. Once the user press and hold down on their mouse, the stick will begin stretching upwards until the mouse is released.

3. When the mouse is released then the stick will stop growing and falls down, and if the user stretch it far enough, then it should land on the platform

4. If the stick lands on the platform, then the ninja will be able to walk across the stick and onto the next platform.

5. When the hero gets to the next platform then the whole scene should transition to the left so that we can center the ninja and the next upcoming platform. Then the loop will repeat steps 1 - 4 (until the ninja falls).

The phases above runs in a loop (in the JS code case, a while loop) until the ninja falls. Which happens when the user makes the stick too long or too short. The different phases are:
IMPORTANT NOTE: This game will not stay the same as is. I plan on adding some cool features to the game to make
it a bit more exciting
